# ðŸ“¦ One package a month challenge

The #1PAM challenge encourage web developers to make one package on your favorite technology / language per month. People can earn experience and level up inside their skills and take place with a known short deadline inside a simple and uncommercial challenge.

## How to contribute

We can register you as a contributor if you want to try this challenge. We will add a link where you upload your packages (Github, Gitlab, Twitter account, ...), simply fill the issue template to contribute.

## Suggest a package

You can also suggest a package inside an issue (there is an issue template for that too)

## Eligibility

You are free to create packages from whatever solutions you want. For example, you can focus on creating Vue libraries a month, or a Laravel package, ...

Any type of package is also eligible. From the simple reusable tool, boilerplates, Wordpress themes, ... As long as it's reusable and it is "code based", it's up to you. As a web developer, I will focus on web solutions but if you're not, this challenge is flexible enough to fit any jobs or hobbies you want.
